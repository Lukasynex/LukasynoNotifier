alarms at specified time(date!) or works as interval(for example - every day at 21:37)

Alarm works in two different types: 
you can set alarm by putting specified date and hour, alarm will fire then.

Another way is to put two parameters: delay time and interval time - alarm will start for the first time after 'delay'
minutes and will be looping for every 'interval' minutes.
